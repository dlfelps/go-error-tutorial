# Go Error Handling Demo

This directory contains a comprehensive tutorial application that demonstrates various error handling patterns in Go.

## What This Demo Covers

The program steps through the following error handling concepts:

1. **Basic Error Handling**
   - The standard `if err != nil` pattern
   - Error checking for common operations like file handling
   
2. **Creating Errors**
   - Using `errors.New` for simple errors
   - Using `fmt.Errorf` for formatted error messages
   
3. **Custom Error Types**
   - Creating structured errors with additional context
   - Type assertions for specific error handling
   
4. **Error Wrapping (Go 1.13+)**
   - Adding context while preserving original errors
   - Using `errors.Unwrap()` and `errors.Is()` functions
   
5. **Panic and Recovery**
   - When to use panic vs. regular error handling
   - Recovering from panics and converting to errors
   
6. **Context-Based Cancellation**
   - Using the context package for timeouts
   - Handling cancellation in operations
   
7. **Concurrent Error Handling**
   - Managing errors across multiple goroutines
   - Collecting all errors vs. fail-fast approaches
   
8. **Sentinel Errors**
   - Using predefined error values
   - Error checking with `errors.Is()`

9. **Best Practices**
   - Guidelines for effective error handling in Go

## Running the Demo

From this directory, simply run:

```bash
go run main.go
```

The program will automatically step through each pattern with code examples and execution results.

## How It Works

Each section demonstrates both the pattern itself and its practical application with real examples. The code shows:

1. What happens when operations succeed
2. What happens when operations fail
3. How to properly handle different error scenarios

## Modifying the Demo

If you'd like to experiment with different error handling patterns:

1. The `main.go` file is organized into sections for each pattern
2. Each pattern has its own function that demonstrates the concept
3. The `main()` function at the bottom calls each demonstration in sequence

Feel free to modify the examples or add your own error handling patterns to learn from!
